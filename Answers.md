1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

    Server side routing has the client send a request to the server for a new web page each time there should be a change to the view of the web page. Client side routing instead pre downloads the entire website and when a new page is clicked on, the client computer serves it up.  Client side routing is much faster once the website is loaded, however it is much slower to initially load.
